# command
A Library to run Application as Subprocesses and to capture STDERR, STDOUT and EXIT CODE in an easy to use way

# Motivation
The `RunCommand` Function from the FreePascal Library is already a useful tool to cover simple execution
of external Programs \
found at https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/fcl/process/runcommand.html \
But for my Use Case it found that for all troublechecking it is crucial to be able to see
all Output on the STDERR Pipe.
